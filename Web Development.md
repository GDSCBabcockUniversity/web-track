Web Development:

1. **Front-end Development**

- HTML: Markup language used for structuring web pages.
- CSS: Stylesheet language used for defining the visual presentation of web pages.
- JavaScript: Programming language used for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.
- Front-end Libraries: Additional libraries and tools that help with front-end development, such as Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, AOS (Animate On Scroll), GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform), React, Vue.js.
- Front-end Frameworks: Comprehensive frameworks that provide structure and tools for building complex web applications, such as Angular, Svelte/SvelteKit, Next.js, Nuxt.js.
- Responsive Web Development: Designing and developing websites that adapt and display properly on different devices and screen sizes.
- Web Accessibility: Ensuring websites are accessible to users with disabilities, following accessibility guidelines and best practices.

2. **Back-end Development**

- Server-side Languages: Programming languages used for building the server-side components of web applications, such as GoLang, PHP, Node.js, Python, C#.
- Web Frameworks: Frameworks that provide a structured environment for building web applications, handling routing, database integration, and other common tasks, such as Laravel, Express.js, Django, .NET.
- BaaS (Backend as a Service): Cloud-based services that provide pre-built backend infrastructure and functionality, enabling developers to focus on the front-end and business logic. Examples include Firebase, SupaBase, PocketBase, AppWrite.
- Databases: Systems used for storing and managing data for web applications, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MS SQL Server.
- RESTful API Development: Designing and implementing APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that follow the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST).
- Authentication and Authorization: Implementing user authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to web applications and resources.
- Cloud Computing Platforms: Cloud service providers, such as Google Cloud, AWS (Amazon Web Services), Azure, that offer scalable and flexible infrastructure for hosting web applications, storage, and other cloud services.

3. **Full-stack Development**

- Combination of front-end and back-end development skills: Having proficiency in both front-end and back-end technologies to develop end-to-end web applications.
- Integrating front-end and back-end components: Connecting the front-end and back-end components of a web application to enable data exchange and functionality.
- Building scalable and robust web applications: Designing and developing web applications that can handle high traffic, scale effectively, and maintain performance and reliability.
